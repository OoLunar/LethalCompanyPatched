# LethalCompanyPatched

This mod is a continuation of the original [An0n_Patches](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/an0nymooose/An0n_Patches/) mod, made by [An0nymooose](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/an0nymooose). This project cleans up the codebase, fixes the crouching bug that didn't respect any remapped keybinds and may optionally add new features in the future.

# Original Description
Crouch Jump, HP and Sprint numbers in the HUD, and all around better movement.

# Features
- HP and Stamina numbers in HUD.
- Instant Sprint speed, no more slow build up
- Instant jump, no delay.
- No slipperiness when turning at sprint speeds
- Crouch Jump!
- Hold CTRL to Crouch - No more crouch toggle.

Instant Sprint speed, slipperiness, Instant Jump, and the HP/Sprint hud can all be configured.
